                    <p>The western and Northern parts of The Netherlands lie between one and six metres below sea level. Much of the land is used for farming or grazing. The territories below sea level used to be lakes or belong to the sea.</p>
                    <h2>Climate</h2>
                    <p>The Netherlands has a maritime climate. It rains a lot and there are only moderate variations in temperature between the four seasons.</p>

                    <h2>Dutch society</h2>
                    <p>The Netherlands is a multicultural society. The twentieth century saw people from the former Dutch colonies in Indonesia, the Moluccas, Surinam and the Dutch Antilles who came to live here.</p>

                    <p>In the 1950s and 1960s Southern Europeans, Moroccans and Turks arrived to alleviate the shortage of factory workers in the Netherlands. In 2004 European borders opened for Eastern European workers. Refugees from all over the world, as well as other groups of immigrants, complete this multicultural picture.</p>
